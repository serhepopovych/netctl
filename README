Netctl bundle package
=====================

This is an umbrella project to join together all netctl based projects
with only purpose to make deployments on target or automation test
system easy.

Current list of subprojects that are part of this superproject:
---------------------------------------------------------------

  o netctl-base - Base filesystem layout for all netctl projects and
                  install system written in POSIX-compatible shell. Used
                  by every netctl based project.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/netctl-base

  o libnctl     - Set of helper libraries written in bash which is used
                  accross the netctl project.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/libnctl

  o libreconf   - Additional library used by re* subprojects (e.g.
                  reipset, reiptables and retc). Written in bash and uses
                  libnctl helper routines.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/libreconf

  o libusrxml   - XML-like structured data to describe subscriber settings
                  like IPv4 and IPv6 address, network interface, traffic
                  control (tc) policies, etc.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/libusrxml

  o netconf     - Network management system. Basically wrapper on top of
                  iproute2 package supporting thousands network 
                  interfaces, routes, etc configurations in simple plain
                  text format that is compatible with iproute2 utilities
                  command line.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/netconf

  o reipset     - Wrapper binary to manage IP sets used by iptables. Can
                  fetch configuration via rsync (including ssh tunneling),
                  local configuration files in ipset(8) format delta
                  updates.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/reipset

  o reiptables  - Wrapper binary to manage iptables/ip6tables firewall.
                  Can load iptables-restore(8) compatible configuration
                  fragments and load rules. Generic rules and conntrack
                  tuning added. Requires specific version of iptables
                  userspace and corresponding kernel space changes.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/reiptables

  o retc        - Wrapper binary to manage traffic control facilities (e.g.
                  apply shaper rules using tc-htb(8) and tc-pfifo(8).
                  Uses libusrxml parsed data, depends on reipset and
                  reiptables.
                  https://github.com/serhepopovych/retc

To install projects system wide you might use following command sequence:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  $ cd /tmp
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/serhepopovych/netctl
  $ cd netctl
  $ ./install.sh

If everything does fine netctl will be installed to '/netctl' and system
wide configuration files to '/etc' and other locations. Unprivileged
user 'reconfigure' may also be created as part of libreconf subproject
installation process.

If you prefer to install netctl into different location and/or put
system wide configuration files to non-root directory you may use DEST
and ROOT environemnt variables to set netctl installation path and
directory used for system wide configuration installations:

  $ DEST='/tmp/netctl-dest' ROOT='/tmp/netctl-root' ./install.sh
